Not depending on engine, these classes are fixtures:
Xinc_Build
Xinc_Project
Xinc_Build_Queue

these need to be fixtures because the reporting will use them
and cannot load all engines/plugins just to show a dashboard

Serialize Xinc_Build_Interface ..

Xinc_Build_Slot replaces Xinc_Plugin_Slot

add a Xinc_Plugin_Task dependsOnEngine():

like that engines can modify/add extend Xinc_Build_Slot and add additional slots
